## https://fridgebook.herokuapp.com/

This application is used to monitor and keep track of your Fridge/Pantry Inventory! 

FridgeBook takes the items in your inventory and provides a dashboard with notifications in order to alert you whether or not it has or will expire. 

The application also takes in account all of your current kitchen items and provides useful recipes, by displaying what you may need to buy or what you can already cook!
